"""
Comprehensive taxonomy for rejection detection model. f

This module defines the multi-head classification taxonomy for detecting and categorizing
AI model responses, particularly focusing on refusal patterns, compliance styles, and safety.

The taxonomy separates behavior (what the model did) from risk (is it harmful) and models
over-refusal explicitly because we care about it.

Scope: Single-turn text completions with multi-head model:
- head_a: Outcome (mutually exclusive)
- head_b_a: Refusal style (diagnostic) 
- head_b_b: Compliance style (diagnostic)
- head_c: Harm categories (multilabel)
- head_d: Binary flags (orthogonal)
